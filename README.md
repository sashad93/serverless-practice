# serverless-practice


This is a serverless lambda practice demo -- I havent had time to finish completely but this is what I've gotten so far after working for a couple hours. The project has basic BREAD/CRUD routes and handlers set up for orders. The next step would be to debug the database so that the GET /order/{id} endpoint is able to retrieve inserted records. After that, adding request validation and possibly auth would be my next steps.



## Installation

Clone the repo and checkout the develop branch

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage


To run, simply run ```npm run dev```

The create order route is POST /order
